KanpurPython is one of the growing Python Community in India.
We have completed almost 1 year 5 months in Kanpur and received enormous amunt of response from students and
professionals. 
We have 50+ active members who are working for spreading the love and passion for Python over entire Kanpur and neighbouring regions. 
Recently we conducted two workshops in reputed colleges of Kanpur named as 'Allenhouse Institute of Technology'-(http://www.allenhouse.ac.in/) & 'Kanpur Institute of
Technology'-(http://kit.ac.in/). 
We are still growing and flourishing in our current domain and we wish to  be  one of the giant & active Python community in India.
